## DOM Manipulation

### Description
This project demonstrates my proficiency in **Document Object Model (DOM) Manipulation**. The main objective is to dynamically update the content and structure of a webpage using JavaScript. Key features include:

- **Dynamic Content Creation:** Add, modify, and remove elements on the page.
- **Event Handling:** Manage user interactions through events such as clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs.
- **Real-time Updates:** Reflect changes on the webpage without reloading, enhancing the user experience.
